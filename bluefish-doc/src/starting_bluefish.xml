<title>Starting Bluefish</title>
<para>Here are the various ways of starting Bluefish.</para>

<sect1 id="launching-bluefish">
<title>Launching Bluefish</title>
<para>In GNOME, Bluefish can be started from the Applications/Programming menu. From a terminal, simply launch bluefish using the command <userinput>bluefish</userinput>.</para>
<note>
<para>In GNOME, bluefish is launched conforming to the system language. If you want to launch it with another language, first rename the directory <filename>$HOME/.bluefish</filename> to <filename>$HOME/.bluefish-xx</filename>, where xx is the previous language. This way you will retrieve your previous settings easily.</para>
<para>Then use this  command in a terminal: <userinput>export LANGUAGE=fr_FR; export LANG=fr_FR; export LC_ALL=fr_FR; bluefish &amp;</userinput> if you use a bash-like shell.</para>
</note>
<para>For French users, if you want to get the custom menu in French language, launch it with the same command as above. If you run bluefish in GNOME, launch it with this command the first time after installation, thereafter you may launch it via the Applications/Programming menu.</para>

<sect1 id="commandline-options">
<title>Command line options</title>
<para>There are several useful command line options:</para>
<variablelist><varlistentry><term>-s</term>
<listitem><para>skip root check</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>-v</term>
<listitem><para>display the current version</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>-n</term>
<listitem><para>open a new window</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>-p filename</term>
<listitem><para>open a project</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>-h</term>
<listitem><para>display this help screen</para></listitem>
</varlistentry></variablelist>
<para>Many programs like browsers, email clients and file managers can be configured to open files in Bluefish. For example, <command>bluefish '%s'</command> will open a file in the current window, <command>bluefish -n '%s'</command> will open a file in a new window, and <command>bluefish -p '%s'</command> will open a project file.</para>
