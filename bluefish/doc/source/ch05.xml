		<title>search and replace (regex patterns)</title>
		<para>
with the search and replace you can do increadible things. We'll start with a simple example. In some HTML table we have several table data tags where we actually want table header tags. Table data is &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; and we want &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;.
		</para>
		<para>
		we can do two normal replaces: one where we replace &lt;td&gt; with &lt;th&gt; and then another where we replace &lt;/td&gt; with &lt;/th&gt;
		</para>
		<para>we can also do one replace using regular expressions: find (&lt;|&lt;/)?td&gt; and replace with \0th&gt; For more information about regular expressions you might want to read man 7 regex, or read any of the great internet sites about regular expressions.</para>
		<para>
		if you understand the above example, you will realize that you can do much more. Suppose you also want to match a table data tag that does have some attributes like &lt;td class=&quot;myclass&quot;&gt;, and you want to keep the option while converting to table header. The following pattern will do this: find (&lt;|&lt;/)td([^&gt;]*)&gt; and replace with \0th\1&gt;
