		<title>Choosing a Version</title>
		<para>
			Currently, four versions of bluefish are available:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				The GTK1-version (v0.7) is deprecated and no longer 
				updated, but is the choice for those of you still running 
				GTK1.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The latest GTK2-version (v1.0) is the version of choice for 
				most users. It's the latest addition to the Bluefish tree, 
				and is regarded as stable enough for daily use.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The latest development snapshot is always one step further 
				than the latest stable release. You'll find some new 
				features, bugs fixes, and a prettier GUI. The catch is that 
				it may have	unfinished or buggy features. Try this if you 
				want to see new features, or if there's a bug in the latest 
				stable release that bothers you.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				CVS - the bleeding edge of Bluefish development. You want 
				this if there's a bug that bothers you, but is unfixed even 
				in the latest snapshot, if you want to contribute a patch, 
				or simply want the bleeding edge feature set. The CVS may 
				be unusable for short periods of time, but will often be 
				stable enough for daily use.
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			As commented in <xref linkend="bluefish-ch-1-sect-1.1"/>, the 
			long time between stable releases make the CVS snapshots and 
			current CVS an enticing choice.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want the latest and greatest, read 
			<xref linkend="bluefish-ch-1-sect-3"/> below. If you simply want to 
			use Bluefish, read <xref linkend="bluefish-ch-1-sect-2"/> for how 
			to get the latest stable package that fit your system.
		</para>

		<sect2 id="bluefish-ch-1-sect-1.1">
			<title>How and When Updates are Released</title>
			<para>
				Often, a long time may pass between each release. Bluefish 
				development is not too rapid, due to the small number of 
				volunteer developers. After all, the developers volunteer their
				time and effort because they actually want to 
				<emphasis>use</emphasis> Bluefish :-)
			</para>
			<para>
				Because of the long periods of time between releases, the 
				current CVS or CVS snapshots may be what you want to use. Bugs 
				will be fixed and new features introduced. We do try to keep 
				the CVS version usable at any time (actually, the CVS version 
				is used by most of the development team on a daily basis).
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="bluefish-ch-1-sect-1.2">
			<title>Operating Systems Supported by Bluefish</title>
			<para>
				Bluefish has been reported to work on a number of systems. The 
				Bluefish team mainly support these platforms:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>Mandrake Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>Red Hat Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>Fedora Core</listitem>
				<listitem>Debian Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>FreeBSD</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>
				Actually, any GNU/Linux distribution with GTK2 is fine and many 
				distributions include Bluefish. In fact, Bluefish will likely 
				work quite well on any POSIX compatible OS where GTK2 is 
				available. Bluefish has been reported to work on the following:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>NetBSD - distributed in pkgsrc</listitem>
				<listitem>OpenBSD - available through their ports system</listitem>
				<listitem>SGI IRIX - see 
					<systemitem class="url">
						http://freeware.sgi.com/
					</systemitem></listitem>
				<listitem>Mac OS X</listitem>
				<listitem>Sun Solaris</listitem>
				<listitem>Tru64</listitem>
				<listitem>AIX</listitem>
				<listitem>HP-UX</listitem>
				<listitem>Win32-cygwin - with a few nags.</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>			
		</sect2>

	<sect1 id="bluefish-ch-1-sect-2">
		<title>Latest Stable Version</title>
		<para>
			Many Linux distributions ship a version of Bluefish or make it 
			available through their package systems. For example, Bluefish 
			is available through the Debian apt-system and FreeBSD's ports.
			You may check if Bluefish is available through your favorite 
			software installer.
		</para>
		<para>
			However, the main source is the Bluefish website, where the 
			software and a few contributions are available. The download 
			page is reachable at 
			<systemitem class="url">
				http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/download.html
			</systemitem>.
			Here, you may download the source code and binary packages for 
			Debian, Red Hat/Fedora, and Mandrake.
