		<title>Choosing a Version</title>
		<para>
			Currently, four versions of bluefish are available:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				The GTK1-version (v0.7) is deprecated and no longer 
				updated, but is the choice for those of you still running 
				GTK1.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The latest GTK2-version (v1.0) is the version of choice for 
				most users, and is regarded as stable enough for daily use.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The latest development snapshot is always one step further 
				than the latest stable release. In it, you will find some new 
				features, bug fixes, and a prettier GUI. The catch is that 
				it may have	unfinished or buggy features. Try this if you 
				want to see new features or are bothered by a bug in 
				the latest stable release.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				CVS is the bleeding edge of Bluefish development. You may 
				find that the CVS version has several bug fixes and enhancements, 
				however, it may also contain new, inadvertent bugs. You will
				also need the CVS version if you want to contribute a patch. 
				Although the CVS version may be unusable for short periods of 
				time, it is often stable enough for daily use.
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			As commented in <xref linkend="getting-bluefish-updates"/>, the 
			long time between stable releases makes the CVS snapshots and 
			current CVS an enticing choice.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want the latest and greatest, read 
			<xref linkend="getting-bluefish-cvs"/> below. If you simply want to 
			use Bluefish, read <xref linkend="getting-bluefish-stable"/> for how 
			to get the latest stable package for your system.
		</para>

		<sect2 id="getting-bluefish-updates">
			<title>How and When Updates are Released</title>
			<para>
				Due to the small number of volunteer developers, the progression of 
				Bluefish's development often fluctuates. For this reason, a long time may 
				pass between each release. After all, the developers 
				volunteer their time and effort because they actually want to 
				<emphasis>use</emphasis> Bluefish :-)
			</para>
			<para>
				Because of the long periods of time between releases, the 
				current CVS or CVS snapshots may be what you want to use. Bugs 
				will be fixed and new features introduced. We do try to keep 
				the CVS version usable at any time (actually, the CVS version 
				is used by most of the development team on a daily basis).
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="getting-bluefish-os">
			<title>Operating Systems Supported by Bluefish</title>
			<para>
				Bluefish has been reported to work on a number of systems. The 
				Bluefish team mainly support these platforms:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>Mandrake Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>Red Hat Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>Fedora Core</listitem>
				<listitem>Debian Linux</listitem>
				<listitem>FreeBSD</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>
				Actually, any GNU/Linux distribution with GTK2 is fine and many 
				distributions include Bluefish. In fact, Bluefish will likely 
				work quite well on any POSIX compatible OS where GTK2 is 
				available. Bluefish has been reported to work on the following:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>NetBSD - distributed in pkgsrc</listitem>
				<listitem>OpenBSD - available through their ports system</listitem>
				<listitem>SGI IRIX - see 
					<ulink url="http://freeware.sgi.com/">
						http://freeware.sgi.com/
					</ulink></listitem>
				<listitem>Mac OS X</listitem>
				<listitem>Sun Solaris</listitem>
				<listitem>Tru64</listitem>
				<listitem>AIX</listitem>
				<listitem>HP-UX</listitem>
				<listitem>Win32-cygwin - with a few nags.</listitem>

	<sect1 id="getting-bluefish-stable">
		<title>Latest Stable Version</title>
		<para>
			Many Linux distributions ship a version of Bluefish or make it 
			available through their package systems. For example, Bluefish 
			is available through the Debian apt-system and FreeBSD's ports.
			You may check if Bluefish is available through your favorite 
			software installer.
		</para>
		<para>
			However, the main source is the Bluefish website, where the 
			software and a few contributions are available. The download 
			page is reachable at 
			<ulink url="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/download.html">http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/download.html</ulink>.
			Here, you may download the source code and binary packages for 
			Debian, Red Hat/Fedora, and Mandrake.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="getting-bluefish-cvs">
		<title>Latest Developmental Version</title>
			<para>
				To get the latest version of Bluefish you will need to 
				download the source files from our CVS repository.
			</para>
			<para>
				CVS
				<footnote><para>Concurrent Versions System</para></footnote>
				, a version control system, is a widely used software development 
				tool. It keeps track of changes to the source code, and allows 
				for reversion to previous states. If you want to read more about CVS, 
				have a look at the CVS-book by Karl Fogel, available at
				<ulink url="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html</ulink>.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Bluefish project's CVS repository is generously hosted by 
				SourceForge.net
				<footnote><para><ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">http://www.sourceforge.net</ulink></para>
				</footnote>.
				For more information about them, see their site. The project 
				homepage is 
				<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluefish">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluefish</ulink>.
				Our CVS repository contains the current Bluefish source code, 
				including this manual. The repository is accessible by anyone, 
				and is updated almost daily by the developers.
			</para>
			<para>
				To access the repository, you need a few small utilities. They 
				are likely to be available through your favorite source of 
				software (ports, apt, etc). The above-mentioned CVS book is a 
				great source for information.
			</para>
			<para>
				The first step is to cd to the directory in which you want to put the 
				sources. Next, log in using the command:
				<screen>$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish \
				login</screen>
				<note>Hit <action>Enter</action> at the password prompt</note>
			</para>
			<para>
				The next step is to <emphasis>check out</emphasis> the CVS module 
				containing the source code files:
				<screen>$Â cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish \
				co bluefish-gtk2</screen>
				A lot of files will be downloaded, and listed one by one. If 
				you're on dial-up, this might take a bit of time.
			</para>
			<para>
				When the downloads have completed, you will find the bluefish 
				sources in the subdirectory	
				<literal>bluefish-gtk2</literal>. You can now enter that directory 
				and install bluefish using the instructions in <xref linkend="installing-bluefish-devel-source" />
			</para>
