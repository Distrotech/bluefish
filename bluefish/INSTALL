To install Bluefish from source:

You can download Bluefish source packages from:
http://www.bennewitz.com/bluefish/stable/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluefish/files/

You can download the current development sources from SVN with:
svn co https://bluefish.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bluefish/trunk/bluefish

0) Installing from SVN requires some additional tools to create the build
   environment:

     automake (>= 1.8), autoconf (>= 2.59), libtool, gettext, intltool

   Then run:

     $ ./autogen.sh

1) Compilation needs the following software packages - usually the headers and
   libraries (search for packages with a -dev or -devel suffix and/or prefix
   lib, e.g. libgtk2.0-dev)

     - Glib 2.0 (>= 2.16)
     - Gtk 2.0 (>= 2.12)
     - gvfs
     - libxml2
     - PCRE
     - enchant (optional for spell checking)
     - gucharmap (optional for character map plugin. Version 2.x is recommended)
     - Python (optional)
     
2) Configure the sources:

     $ ./configure [options-you-like-most-here]

   Calling the command with the --help option will show you all available
   options. They usually contain a help string to explain their function.

3) Compile the sources (report any errors, see README):

     $ make

4) Install everything. This usually needs root privileges:

     # make install


For several Linux distributions compiled packages are available (e.g. Debian,
Ubuntu, Fedora) made by Bluefish developers and supporters. See our website,
 http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/ for more information.
