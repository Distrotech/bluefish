BFTEXTVIEW2 DESIGN DOCS

requirements: a textwidget with
- syntax highlighting
- block folding
- context-sensitive autocompletion
- for various languages
- fast (doesn't lock the GUI when syntaxt-scanning very large files)

DESIGN:
- to avoid locking the GUI, it should be able to scan in multiple runs
  - it should be able to mark a region as 'needs scanning'
  - it should be able to resume scanning on any point marked as 'needs scanning'

- scanning is done with patterns that scan within a context
 - for e.g. php we start with an html context that scans for html tags and it scans
   for the php-open tag <?php
  - within a html tag we scan the html-attribute context and we scan for the end-of-tag '>'
  - withing <?php we scan for functions/variables and for end-of-php '?>'
- autocompletion is also done based on the context. so for autocompletion we look-up
  the context, and based on the context we know the possibilities
  - for e.g. scanning within the '<img' html tag context we know that 'src' is one of
    the valid attributes
- the context is kept on a stack. once the end-of-context pattern is found (a pattern that has
nextcontext -1), we revert to the previous context

- changed areas are marked with a GtkTextTag called 'needscanning'.
 - a idle function is started (if not running) to do the actual scanning
 - the scanner keeps a timer and stops scanning once a certain time has passed
 - if the scanning is finished the idle function stops

- to find where to resume scanning it simply searches for the first position
  that is marked with this tag and backs-up to the beginning of the line
 - to know which patterns to use we have to know in which context we are. we therefore keep
   a cache of the (context)stack. on each position where to contextstack changes, we make a copy
   of the current stack that we keep in a sorted balanced tree (a GSequence), sorted by the
   character offset in the text.
   - the positions change when text is inserted or deleted, but never their order. a GSequence
     allows us to update the offsets for the stacks without re-sorting the entire tree
 - same holds for the blocks. we keep a blockstack, and we keep a cache of the blockstack in the
   same stackcache as where we keep the contextstack.

- to paint the margin and detect if we can expand/collapse blocks, we can use this same
  scancache. Along with walking the lines we walk the GSequence and see if there are new
  blocks that can be folded.

- the current scanning is based on Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) just like the 1.1.6
unstable engine (see wikipedia for more info). The 1.1.6 engine alloc's each state in a
separate memory block. This new engine alloc's a large array for all states at once, so you can
simply move trough the array instead of following pointers. Following the DFA is then as simple
as state = table[state][character]; where state is just an integer position in the array, and
character is the current character you're scanning. I hope the array will help to speed up
the scanner. I used guint16 because I suspect that we never hit the 65500 states (largest
patterns set right now is php, 4500 functions use 32000 states)

- DFA table's for multiple contexts are all in the same memory block. Each context has an offset
where it starts. When a match is found, scanning can move to a different context. For example
when <?php is found, we switch to row 123 of the DFA table from which all php functions are scanned.

- Compared to the engine in the 1.0 series the main advantage is that we do only a single scanning
run for all patterns in a given context. The 1.0 scanner does multiple scanning runs for <\?php
and for <[a-z]+>. The new engine scans (<\?php|<[a-z]+>) but knows that both sub-patterns lead
to different results (different color, different context).

========== language parsing from the XML file ==========
- the languages are defined in an XML file. On startup, only the header of that file is parsed,
into a Tbflang struct, which defines the language and the mime types. Only when scanning for
one of these mime-types is requested the rest of the file is parsed (in a separate thread!!!)
and the DFA for this language is created. This saves memory and startup time for languages
that are not used in a certain session.

For parsing we use the libxml2 textreader interface
http://xmlsoft.org/xmlreader.html
It does not need to load the full XML file into memory, it
is a parser that moves through the file while parsing. This
makes it an excellent choice to quickly parse large language
files in order to build the DFA table.

A tag, keyword or patterns may have a class="foo" attribute. This pattern is only
added to the DFA when option "foo" is enabled. This way we can have gtk functions
in the C patterns for those of us that do GTK programming in Bluefish. All
others will have a much smaller DFA table for the C language.

========== Symbols and identifiers in the DFA table ==========
Each context has symbols. Symbols are characters that may start or end a pattern.
Try to highlight for example:
 char *rc_char(char*chara);
 ^^^^          ^^^^
Only two of the four 'char' need to be highlighted. How does the scanner know which
one to highlight? In the above example there are several symbols such as whitespace
, brackets and operators:
 char *rc_char(char*chara);
^    ^^       ^    ^     ^^
see that the occurences of 'char' that should be highlighted are all in between symbols?!

The DFA table has a startstate for each context and an identifier-state (identstate).
In the next example state 0 is the startstate and state 1 the identstate:

|state|| space| a | c | h | r | * | ( | ) | _ | have match ?
|  0  ||   0  | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | no
|  1  ||   0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | no
|  2  ||   0  | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | no
|  3  ||   0  | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | no
|  4  ||   0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | no
|  5  ||   0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | yes! we have: char

now try to parse the bit '(char*' starting at state 0 (the startstate)
( -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. no
c -> state 2
h -> state 3
a -> state 4
r -> state 5
* -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. YES!

now try to scan the bit '*rc_char('
* -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. no
r -> state 1
c -> state 1
_ -> state 1
c -> state 1
h -> state 1
a -> state 1
r -> state 1
( -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. no

now try to scan the bit ' chara)':
  -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. no
c -> state 2
h -> state 3
a -> state 4
r -> state 5
a -> state 1
) -> state 0 if we find state 0 we check if there is a match.. no

as you see, the scanner is stuck in state 1 (the identstate) if
either on the start or on the end there is no symbol.
