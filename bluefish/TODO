TODOs:

- Cancelling the Open Advanced dialog leads to "No matching files found.",
  which is unexpected, because the dialog was cancelled.

- "/File/tearoff1", "/File/sep1" should not be translatable

- src/quickstart.c: "Href" (and similar) should be "href" ((X)HTML syntax)
  in dialogs, if they mean attributes

- ./src/gtk_easy.c:1264 is "Select File" and ../src/gtk_easy.c:1594 is
  "Select file" -> such strings should be the same (similar for "Email" and
  "E-Mail")

- ../src/menu.c:424 "/Tags/Special/Accent/Uppercase/J-Z/OE ligature" misses
  the UTF-8 encoded sign
