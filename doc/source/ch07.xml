		<title>Indenting and formating style</title>
		<para>Indenting can be done with the indent utility. Bluefish 
		uses tabs - not spaces, and I'll explain why. Some programmers
		prefer a lot of indenting, 8 characters, some prefer less, 3 
		characters. If Bluefish code was indented with spaces, these
		programmers had a problem, they would have to change the files
		to view it in their favourite layout. But because we use tabs, 
		these programmers can simply set the tab width to a different 
		value, and without changing the files it looks good for both 
		programmers!
		</para>
		<para>
			indent --line-length 100 --k-and-r-style --tab-size 4 -bbo --ignore-newlines bluefishcode.c
		</para>
	<para>
	comment all public functions like it is done in bf_lib.c and gtk_easy.c (javadoc style, with some small differences), this can be used to create a function reference
	</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="bluefish-ch-7-sect-3">
		<title>naming</title>
		<para>
			for non-local functions, the name should prefferably include a prefix that shows 
			the part of bluefish it is used for. There are, furthermore, many often used 
			abbreviations in the bluefish code, such as:
		</para>
		
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>doc - a function handling on a specific document</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>bfwin - a function handing on a specific Bluefish window</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>cb - callback, a function called after a button click or some other event</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>lcb - local callback, a function called after an event, only used in this .c file</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		Example function names that show where they are from, what they handle, and/or what they do:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>bmark_set_for_doc - bookmark code, sets bookmarks for a document</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>spell_check_cb - spell check code, this is a callback function (for a button)</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>project_open_from_file - project code, opens a new project from a given file name</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="bluefish-ch-7-sect-4">
		<title>Declaring procedures</title>
		<para>
			All local functions should be static! Callback functions (called for events 
			such as button clicks) should have prefix _cb, or _lcb for local callbacks.
		</para>

		<para>
				for gtk callback functions, use the name of the signal in the name
		</para>
		
	</sect1>
	<sect1 id="bluefish-ch-7-sect-5">
		<title>header files</title>
		<para>
			Only functions that are used from outside the file itself 
			should be in the header file, in the order in which they
			are found in the .c file itself. Basically these are all
			non-static functions in the .c file.

	  <listitem><para>copy this original tree, so you can make a patch against this tree</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Before creating the patch:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>run make distclean && ./configure && make and test if it runs successfull</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>if you have the possibility do this both with gcc-2.95 and gcc-3. as compiler</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Now create the patch. Suppose you have two directories, original-tree and my-tree</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>run make distclean in both trees</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>cd to the parent dir of the two trees</para></listitem>
