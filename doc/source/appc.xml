  <title>Guidelines for Writing this Manual</title>

	<sect1 id="bluefish-APP-manual-intro">
		<title>Introduction to DocBook</title>
		<para>
			The Bluefish manual is written in 
			<ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</ulink> XML, which is 
			a set of standards for writing documentation. Originally, DocBook 
			was intended for computer software documentation, but is now used 
			for many other document types.

			<para>
				To generate HTML or PDF files out of the source XML, you 
				will need the following:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Bluefish Manual Source Files
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							DocBook Document Type Definition (DTD)
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							DocBook XSL stylesheets
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							XSLT Processor
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>
				To get the Bluefish XML source, we use cvs. To login:
				<screen>$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bluefish.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish login</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				You will be prompted for a password. Since we are 
				logging in anonymously, you can just hit enter without 
				providing any password. Next we will checkout the directory 
				containing the Bluefish documentation:
				<screen>$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bluefish.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish co bluefish-gtk2/doc</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				This will download all the files to your system in the 
				directory <literal>bluefish-gtk2/doc/</literal>. Next, 
				we will get the DTD and the stylesheets, which are in 
				CVS under <literal>bluefish-doctools</literal>:
				<screen>$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bluefish.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish co bluefish-gtk2/doc</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, you need the 
				<ulink url="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</ulink> 
				libraries installed on your system. libxslt is distributed 
				as part of the GNOME desktop environment and is packaged 
				for most Linux distributions. 
				<ulink url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</ulink> 
				provides the packages for Mac OS X. The XSLT processor 
				<literal>xsltproc</literal> is provided by the libxslt
				library and is the command which will convert the DocBook
				source into HTML files. 
			</para>
			<para>
				The files must be in the right place.
			</para>
			<para>
				To create a one-page HTML file:
				
				To break the sections into multiple pages with navigation
				links (a process known as chunking):

	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="bluefish-APP-manual-conventions">
 		<title>Conventions for Writing this Manual</title>
 			<para>
 				The DocBook rules are strict and must be maintained in 
 				order to for the manual to build using 
 				<literal>xsltproc</literal>. However, there are some
 				rules we like to follow to make editing the manual 
 				more efficient and organized. 
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				Let's establish rules for <literal>id</literal> names.
 				All <literal>id</literal> names should begin with the 
 				name of the book. In our case the main book file is 
 				<emphasis>bluefish.xml</emphasis>, so every <literal>id</literal>
 				should beging with <emphasis>bluefish</emphasis>.
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				Separate words in the <literal>id</literal> with hyphens.
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				After the book name, use a capitalized abbreviation of the 
 				type of XML tag to which the <literal>id</literal> belongs.
 				For example, use <emphasis>bluefish-SECT1</emphasis> for a 
 				<literal>&lt;sect1&gt;</literal> section <literal>id</literal>.
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				List of abbr. should go here after we agree as to what they are.
 				<variablelist>
 					<title>Bluefish DocBook Tag Abbreviations</title>
					<varlistentry>
						<term><abbrev>SECT1</abbrev></term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								sect1 - change 1 to 2 for sect2, etc 
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				Finally, include a word or two describing the content in the 
 				section. Using our example, a top-level section titled <literal>Introduction to Bluefish</literal>
				would have the id <emphasis>bluefish-SECT1-intro</emphasis>
 			</para>
 			<para>
 				The main thing is that all id's must be unique.
 			</para>
