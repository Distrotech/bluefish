  <title>Guidelines for Writing this Manual</title>

	<sect1 id="bluefish-manual-guide-intro">
		<title>Introduction to DocBook</title>
		<para>
			The Bluefish manual is written in 
			<ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</ulink> XML, which is 
			a set of standards for writing documentation. Originally, DocBook 
			was intended for computer software documentation, but is now used 
			for many other document types.

		<title>Building the Manual</title>
			<para>
				To generate HTML or PDF files out of the source XML, you 
				will need the following:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Bluefish Manual Source Files
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							DocBook Document Type Definition (DTD)

				To get the Bluefish XML source, we use CVS. To login:
				<screen>$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish \ 
				login</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				You will be prompted for a password. Since we are 
				logging in anonymously, you can just hit enter without 
				providing any password. Next we will checkout the directory 
				containing the Bluefish documentation:
				<screen>$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish \
				co bluefish-gtk2/doc</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				This will download all the files to your system in the 
				directory <literal>bluefish-gtk2/doc/</literal>. Next, 
				we will get the DTD and the style sheets, which are in 
				CVS under <literal>bluefish-doctools</literal>:
				<screen>$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish \
				co bluefish-gtk2/doc</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, you need the 
				<ulink url="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</ulink> 
				libraries installed on your system. libxslt is distributed 
				as part of the GNOME desktop environment and is packaged 
				for most Linux distributions. 
				<ulink url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</ulink> 
				provides the packages for Mac OS X. The XSLT processor 
				<literal>xsltproc</literal> is provided by the libxslt
				library and is the command which will convert the DocBook
				source into HTML files. 
			</para>
			<para>
				The files must be in the right place.

				links (a process known as chunking):

	<sect1 id="bluefish-manual-guide-conventions">
 		<title>Conventions for Writing this Manual</title>
 			<para>
 				The DocBook rules are strict and must be maintained in 
 				order for the manual to build using 
 				<literal>xsltproc</literal>. However, there are some
 				rules we like to follow to make editing the manual 
 				more efficient and organized. 
 			</para>
 			<sect2 id="bluefish-manual-guide-id-names">
 				<title>The <literal>id</literal> Attribute</title>
	 			<para>
	 				All <literal>id</literal> names should begin with the 
	 				name of the book. In our case the main book file is 
	 				<emphasis>bluefish.xml</emphasis>, so every <literal>id</literal>
	 				should begin with <emphasis>bluefish</emphasis>.
	 			</para>
	 			<para>
	 				Separate words in the <literal>id</literal> with hyphens.
	 			</para>
	 			<para>
	 				Finally, include a word or two describing the content in the 
	 				section. For example, a chapter entitled 
	 				<literal>Using Bluefish</literal>
					would have the id <emphasis>bluefish-using</emphasis>. And,
					a section within that chapter called 
					<literal>Keyboard Shortcuts</literal> could have the name 
					<emphasis>bluefish-using-shortcuts</emphasis>.
	 			</para>
	 			<para>
	 				The main thing is that all id's must be unique or processing will 
	 				fail. Also, be careful when renaming id's, since the name could be 
	 				used in links within other parts of the manual. It's best to do 
	 				a global search for an id in all the manual's files before changing 
	 				an id.

 			If you find errors in the manual, or just want to add more, please 
 			<link linkend="bluefish-contact">contact</link> us. If you have questions
 			on how to edit the manual that are not addressed in this appendix, you can 
 			always ask on the <link linkend="bluefish-contact">mailing list</link>. Often, 
 			you can look to the chapter source to see how things are done.
