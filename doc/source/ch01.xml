		<para>
			The next chapter, the tutorial, is highly recommended for the novice user.
			It will present a step-by-step introduction to the main features of Bluefish,
			aiming to supply a short description of the most used features.
		</para>
		<para>
			The rest of the manual contains a complete feature reference, from basic to advanced features.

		<title>what is bluefish?</title>
		<para>
			Bluefish is a powerful editor for experienced web designers and programmers. Bluefish
			supports many programming and markup languages, but it focuses on editing dynamic and
			interactive websites.
		</para>
		<para>
			Bluefish is a WYSIWYM<footnote><para>What You See Is What You Mean</para></footnote> text editor,
			letting you, the programmer, stay in full control over the code by editing it by hand.
			To alleviate the editing process, a large number of features are at your disposal. Numerous methods for
			inserting markup and code exists, through toolbars, dialogs and predefined and user customized menus.
			Syntax highlighting, advanced search and replace functionality, scalability and language function
			references make Bluefish a powerful tool.

					Several years has passed since the first Bluefish release. In that time, the fish has
					gained a reputation for being an excellent editor,
					with qualities like stability, usability and numerous features. Also, Bluefish is small

			<para>
				As Bluefish is a part of a larger desktop enviroment, we have begun to focus on keeping the GUI
				consistent with the Gnome HIG<footnote>
					<para>GNOME Human Interface Guidelines, accessible at
						<systemitem class="url">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/</systemitem>
					</para></footnote>. However, we prefer not following it in every detail,
					as some parts are noticeably <emphasis>for the end user</emphasis>, while
					Bluefish is <emphasis>for the programmer</emphasis>.

			<para>
				The Bluefish developers aim to produce code that neither crash nor leak memory. Of course, that's
				not always easy to do, but we do try to minimize the damage. Leaks and crashes
				are often fixed in CVS as soon as they're discovered and hunted down. The developers use the
				Bluefish for their daily work, in addition to a large amount of users. Some nags do still exist,
				one problem is slightly slow copy/pasting.
