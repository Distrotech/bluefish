		<title>About this Manual</title>
		<para>
			Bluefish has a large feature set, allowing the user to customize the
			editing experience in numerous ways. This manual targets the novice 
			user, providing a starting point for mastering Bluefish. However, 
			advanced users will still find this text an excellent reference.
		</para>
		<para>
			Chapters 1-4 are highly recommended for anyone new to Bluefish.
			They present general information, installation instructions, and an
			introduction to the main features of Bluefish.
		</para>
		<para>
			Chapters 5 and 6 contain a nearly complete feature reference, useful
			for advanced users interested in customizing Bluefish. Some examples
			of regular expressions used for find and replace are also included 
			here.
		</para>
		<para>
			As a reference to the Bluefish developers, or anyone interested in 
			contributing code, chapter 7 contains guidelines for the 
			Bluefish source.
		</para>
		<para>
			The manual is targeted the <emphasis>end user</emphasis>. Thus, we 
			have tried to use a simple, well-explained approach for the large 
			part of the manual. Some typographic conventions are denoted below.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				Any urls are denoted like this: 
					<systemitem class="url">
						http://bluefish.openoffice.nl
					</systemitem>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Shortcuts look like this: <accel>Ctrl-S</accel>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Menu options are displayed like this: 
					<guimenu>
						File
					</guimenu> 
				However, many of Bluefish's menus are quite complex. When 
				refering to submenus, options are separated by the right 
				angle-bracket (>), like: 
					<guimenuitem>
						File > Open
					</guimenuitem>
				.
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				When refering to user input, like issuing commands to the 
				command prompt, a monotype font is used:
				<screen>$ foo -bar | bang -l</screen>
				Note: Do not write the <literal>$</literal> character - it's 
				simply identifying	the command prompt. For commands requiring 
				root access, the prompt is shown as a <literal>#</literal>.

		<title>What is Bluefish?</title>
		<para>
			Bluefish is a powerful editor for experienced web designers and 
			programmers based on the GTK2 GUI interface. Bluefish supports many 
			programming and markup languages, but focuses on editing dynamic and
			interactive websites.
		</para>
		<para>
			Bluefish is not a WYSIWYG<footnote><para>What You See Is What You 
			Get</para></footnote> text editor. This is deliberate, allowing the 
			programmer to stay in full control. To alleviate the editing 
			process, a large number of features are at your disposal. For 
			inserting markup and code, there are toolbars, dialogs, and 
			predefined/user-customized menus. Syntax highlighting, advanced 
			search/replace functionality, scalability and language function
			references make Bluefish a powerful tool for development.

			<title>History of Bluefish</title>
			<remark>left for someone else to write ;-) - christian</remark>
			<remark>also left for someone else to write :o( - scott</remark>
			<para>
				Several years have passed since the first Bluefish release. 
				Since that time, the fish has gained a reputation as an 
				excellent editor, with qualities like stability, usability and 
				numerous features. Also, Bluefish is small and needs only GTK2 
				to function, making it usable even on slow machines.

				Some features from v0.7 (GTK1) are not yet implemented. The main
				missing piece is project management, which will be implemented 
				before v1.0. If you depend on this feature, v0.7 may still be 
				the version of choice.

			<title>How Stable is Bluefish?</title>
			<para>
				Quite stable! The Bluefish developers aim to produce code that 
				neither crashes nor leaks memory. Of course, that's not always 
				easy to do. Leaks and crashes are often fixed in CVS as soon as 
				they're discovered and hunted down. In addition to Bluefish's 
				large userbase, the developers use Bluefish for their daily 
				work. So, fixing bugs and preventing crashes is always a major 
				priority. However, some nags still exist. One example being the 
				issue of slightly sluggish copy/paste functions.
