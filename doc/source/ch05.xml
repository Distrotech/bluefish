	  <para> HTML is obviously the most supported language in Bluefish. There is a
	  special HTML toolbar with many dialogs, and several menu sections to work
	  with tags. You can also right-click a tag and bring up the dialog from
	  there.</para> <para> In the reference tree on the left panel there is also
	  HTML reference available.</para> <para>There are several special search and
	  replace actions in the menu Edit-Replace special. These can be used to
	  convert special characters (like &lt; and &amp;), or iso characters to their
	  HTML entities.</para> </sect2>

  <sect1 id="bluefish-ch-5-sect-3"><title>search and replace (regex
  patterns)</title> 
  
  <para> With the search and replace you can do incredible
  things. We'll start with a simple example. In some HTML table we have
  several table data tags where we actually want table header tags. Table data
  is &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; and we want &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;. </para> <para>
  we can do two normal replaces: one where we replace &lt;td&gt; with
  &lt;th&gt; and then another where we replace &lt;/td&gt; with &lt;/th&gt;
  </para> <para>we can also do one replace using regular expressions: find
  (&lt;|&lt;/)?td&gt; and replace with \0th&gt; For more information about
  regular expressions you might want to read man 7 regex, or read any of the
  great internet sites about regular expressions. The \0 in the replace string
  refers to the first subpattern match in the search pattern, the \1 to the
  second etc.</para> <para> if you understand the above example, you will
  realize that you can do much more. Suppose you also want to match a table
  data tag that does have some attributes like &lt;td class="myclass"&gt;, and
  you want to keep the option while converting to table header. The following
  pattern will do this: find (&lt;|&lt;/)td([^&gt;]*)&gt; and replace with
  \0th\1&gt; </para> <para> if you have any search and replace patterns you
  use often, you can also add them to the Custom Menu. Check the Custom Menu
  section of this manual for more information. </para>
  
  <para>
  In the search and the search and replace dialog it is not possible to insert keys 
  Enter or Tab. You can, however, insert escape characters, if you enable the 
  'Patterns contain backslash sequences' option. If you use this option, you can
  add a newline to your pattern as \n, a tab as a \t, and a backslash becomes a 
  \\.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  Another useful option in the search dialog is the <emphasis>bookmark results
  </emphasis> option. For example in a php document, you could search for the
  word 'function', and add a bookmark to every function. This results, however,
  in a list of bookmarks that are all named 'function'. Not so useful. But also
  now we can make use of a regular expression. The expression 
  'function[ \t\n]+[&amp;a-zA-Z0-9_]+' will result in all functions and their name.
  Much more useful!
  </para>

  <sect1 id="bluefish-ch-5-sect-4"><title>project management</title> <para>The
  projects are a sort of 'saved state' of Bluefish. All files open when the
  project is saved, are automatically opened the next time you open the
  project. Also the recently used files in that project are shown in the
  recent menu. Furthermore, a basedir can be set, so the filebrowser in the
  left panel will only show the files in the basedir and its subdirectories.
  If Bluefish is installed with gnome-vfs support the basedir might be remote,
  for example sftp://someserver/somedir or
  smb://user:password@server/someshare/.</para> <para>If the webdir is entered
  in the project settings, Bluefish will launch the browser to the appropriate
  URL. If your basedir for example is /var/www/ and your webdir
  http://localhost/ Bluefish will use this information to launch the browser
  to the correct URL. This can be very convenient for testing server side
  scripting languages like PHP, JSP or other.</para> <para>The template field
  can point to a template file. If the 'new file' button is clicked, the
  contents of this file will be automatically loaded into the edit
  window.</para> <para>The projects will be expanded to have more Bluefish
  settings, so a project can be a bit of customized Bluefish setup. Currently
  the state of various toolbars and menubars is saved in a project
  file.</para> <para>The project file itself is simply a textfile in the
  standard Bluefish format (same format as the config file). This format is
  'key: value'.</para></sect1>

  <sect1 id="bluefish-ch-5-sect-5"><title>Running External
  Programs</title><para>Bluefish allows external programs or scripts to be run
  via the "External" menu. To add items to this
  menu:</para><para><orderedlist><listitem><para>Edit &gt;
  Preferences</para></listitem><listitem><para>Choose the "External Programs"
  tab.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Click "Add" to add a new
  item</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the name field to give
  the command a name (this name will become an option in the "External"
  menu).</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the command field to
  type the command to be
  executed.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para><para>I WILL ADD AN EXAMPLE
  HERE LATER</para><para>Items within External &gt; Outputbox allow for
  programs to give feedback by opening an output box within Bluefish's main
  window. To create an Outputbox menu item: <orderedlist><listitem><para>Edit
  &gt; Preferences</para></listitem><listitem><para>Choose the "Output
  parsers" tab.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Click "Add" to add a new
  item</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the name field to give
  the command a name (this name will become an option in the "External"
  menu).</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the pattern field
  and give a regular expression pattern with subpatterns, such as line
  ([0-9]+) column [0-9]+ - (.*).</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click
  on the "File #" field and give the number for the subpattern matching the
  filename (-1 for none)</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the
  "Line #" field and give the number for the subpattern matching the line
  number</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the "Output #" field
  and give the number for the subpattern matching the actual error
  message</para></listitem><listitem><para>Double-click on the "Command" field
  and the command to execute, %s is the current
  filename</para></listitem><listitem><para>Toggle the "Show all output"
  checkbox to show output NOT matching the regular
  expression.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para><remark>Note: Of course,
  it is also possible to add these items by editing the file named "rcfile_v2"
  found in the user's home directory (~/.bluefish/rcfile_v2). The fields are
  delimited by colons and correspond to those found in the
  GUI.</remark></sect1>
