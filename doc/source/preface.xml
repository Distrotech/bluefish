    <title>About this Manual</title>
    <para>
			Bluefish has a large feature set, allowing the user to customize the
			editing experience in numerous ways. This manual targets both novice 
			and advanced users, providing a full resource for everyone.
	</para>
	<para>
			Chapters 1-3 are highly recommended for anyone new to Bluefish.
			They present general information, installation instructions, and an
			introduction to the main features of Bluefish.
	</para>
	<para>
			Chapter 4 explains how to debug Bluefish.
	</para>
	<para>
			Chapters 5 contains a nearly complete feature reference, useful
			for advanced users interested in customizing Bluefish. 
	</para>
	<para>
			Chapters 6 provides guidance for developers, including code formatting
			styles and a reference for all the source files.
	</para>
    <para>
			The manual targets the <emphasis>end user</emphasis>. To that end, we 
			have tried to use a simple, well-explained approach whenever possible. 
			Some typographic conventions are denoted below.
	</para>
    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
				Any URLs are denoted like this: 
					<ulink url="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl">
						http://bluefish.openoffice.nl
					</ulink>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
				Shortcuts look like this: <accel>Ctrl-S</accel>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			Menu options are displayed like this: 
			<guimenu>
				File
			</guimenu> 
			However, many of Bluefish's menus are quite complex. When 
			referring to submenus, options are separated by an arrow, like:
			<menuchoice>
				<shortcut>
					<keycombo>
						<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
						<keycap>O</keycap>
					</keycombo>
				</shortcut>
				<guimenu>File</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>. The default keyboard shortcut is shown in parenthesis.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
				When referring to user input, like issuing commands to the 
				command prompt, a monotype font is used:
				<screen>$ foo -bar | bang -l</screen>
				<note>Note: Do not write the <literal>$</literal> character - it 
				simply identifies the command prompt. For commands requiring 
				root access, the prompt is shown as a <literal>#</literal>.</note>

    <title>What is Bluefish?</title>
    <para>
			Bluefish is a powerful editor for experienced web designers and 
			programmers based on the GTK2 GUI interface. Bluefish supports many 
			programming and markup languages, but focuses on editing dynamic and
			interactive websites.
	</para>
    <para>
			Bluefish is not a WYSIWYG<footnote><para>What You See Is What You 
			Get</para></footnote> text editor. This is deliberate, allowing the 
			programmer to stay in full control. To facilitate the editing 
			process, a large number of features are at your disposal. For 
			inserting markup and code, there are tool bars, dialogs, and 
			predefined/user-customized menus. Syntax highlighting, advanced 
			search/replace functionality, scalability and language function
			references make Bluefish a powerful tool for development.
	</para>

      <title>History of Bluefish</title>
<para>
Bluefish development started under a different name. 
A good and free text editor targeted towards web development was not available.
Olivier Sessink started the project ProSite. Chris Mazuc also
started an HTML editor. On a GTK 
development mailing list, Olivier Sessink and Chris Mazuc saw each others postings, and 
decided to team up. Olivier had a basic editor, Chris had many HTML dialogs ready. After
merging the code this was for a while known as the Thtml editor. 
</para><para>
After a while Neil Millar joined the project to add weblint integration and a color dialog. 
Because the project became larger and more mature, a logo was wanted. After many discussions
about boring logos, Neil Millar came up with a cute blue fish. Because this logo was
appreciated by all, the name changed into the final name Bluefish.
</para>
<para>After this initial stage, many developers, translators, testers and users joined
the project. </para>
       <para>
				Several years have passed since the first Bluefish release. 
				Since that time, the fish has gained a reputation as an 
				excellent editor, with qualities like stability, usability and 
				numerous features. Also, Bluefish is small, fast and efficient, 
				making it usable even on slow machines.

				Some features from v0.7 (GTK1) are not yet implemented. The main
				missing piece is project management, which will be implemented 
				before v1.0. If you depend on this feature, v0.7 may still be 
				the version of choice.

    <sect2 id="bluefish-stability">
      <title>How Stable is Bluefish?</title>
      <para>
				Quite stable! The Bluefish developers aim to produce code that 
				neither crashes nor leaks memory. Of course, that is not always 
				easy to do. Leaks and crashes are often fixed in CVS as soon as 
				they are discovered and hunted down. In addition to Bluefish's 
				large user base, the developers use Bluefish for their daily 
				work. So, fixing bugs and preventing crashes is always a major 
				priority. However, some nags still exist. One example being the 
				issue of slightly sluggish copy/paste functions.
			</para>
      <para>
