		<title>syntax highlighting</title>
		<para>
			Syntax highlighting is the coloring of words that have a 
			special meaning in the language you are writing. Obviously the patterns 
			are different for every language. The "&lt;title&gt;" word for example means
			"start of title" in HTML, the "function" word means "start of function" in PHP.
		</para>

				why using syntax highlighting?
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="bluefish-ch-4-sect-8.2">
			<title>modifying highlight patterns</title>
			<para>The highlight patterns are build from perl compatible regular expressions. A pattern has 
			options for coloring and style of the text it matches. Within a match other patterns can be used 
			to color parts of that match. There are three
			types of patterns:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>1 Two patterns, match from the start to the end pattern</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>2 One pattern that matches from start to end</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>3 Match a subpattern from the parent pattern</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
		One specific pattern can also be used within several other parent patterns. The parent-match
		option is a regular expression that defines all parents for a certain pattern. If emty
		it will default to ^top$, so basically it will be on the top level.
	</para><para>
	So how does it work? Lets take a look at a little example text, a piece of PHP code within some html code:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
// this is a comment ?&gt;
?&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
The first thing the highlighting engine does is finding the pattern that has the lowest match. Using the default patterns for PHP, the pattern named <literal>html</literal> has a match at position 0:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
So now the highlightiong engine searches for the lowest match in all subpatterns of <literal>html</literal>, in the region matched by the type 2 <literal>html</literal> pattern. Again, the lowest match will count. The pattern named <literal>html-tag</literal> has a match at position 1. This pattern is a type 3 pattern, so it matches a subpattern of the parent:
</para>
<programlisting>
p
</programlisting>
<para>
the match from subpattern <literal>html-tag</literal> ends at position 2 and it does not have any child patterns, so the highlighting engine continues at position 2 with all subpatterns from <literal>html</literal>. A type 2 pattern named <literal>html-attrib</literal> has the lowest match:
</para>
<programlisting>
align=&quot;center&quot;
</programlisting>
<para>
This pattern does have a child pattern, again a type 3 pattern called <literal>html-attrib-sub2</literal> matching:
</para>
<programlisting>
&quot;center&quot;
</programlisting>
<para>
The pattern <literal>html-attrib-sub2</literal> does not have any child patterns, and subpatterns of <literal>html-attrib</literal> do not have any more matches, and also <literal>html</literal> subpatterns do not have any more matches. So we are back on the main level, the remaining code to highlight is:
</para>
<programlisting>
&lt;?php
// this is a comment ?&gt;
?&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
Now a pattern named <literal>php</literal> has the lowest match. This is a type 0 pattern, so the highlight engine continues with all the remaining code, but it will not only search for the lowest match of the child patterns of <literal>php</literal>, but it will also use for the end pattern of <literal>php</literal>. The lowest match in this example is a pattern named <literal>php-comment-C++</literal> As you can see the ?&gt; within the comment does not end the <literal>php</literal> pattern, because it lies within a subpattern of <literal>php</literal>:
</para>
<programlisting>
// this is a comment ?&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
The pattern <literal>php-comment-C++</literal> does not have any child patterns, so the remaining code for the <literal>php</literal> subpatterns is:
</para>
<programlisting>
?&gt;
</programlisting>
<para>
It is very obvious now, the lowest match will be the end pattern of the <literal>php</literal> pattern, so we're back on the main level, and we have matched all of the code!
</para>
