			<para>The project bluefish is hosted by SourceForge.net 
			<systemitem class="url">http://sourceforge.net</systemitem>.
			For more information read the documentation there.
			The project homepage is 
			<systemitem class="url">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluefish</systemitem>.
			For managing the changes of the devolopers, a version controll system ist
			 installed.
			If you still nothing heared about cvs, check the CVS-Book of Karl Fogel
			<systemitem class="url">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html</systemitem>.
			To the cvs repository, where the bluefish sources are, everyone have access
			to read them.</para>
			<para>The sources can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with 
			the following instruction set.
			The module you wish to check out must be specified as the modulename. 
			For the bluefish gtk2 version, it's <literal>bluefish-gtk2</literal>.</para>
			<para>First, you have to login:
			<screen>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bluefish.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish login</screen>
			When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the <action>Enter</action> key.
			and second, check out the module:
			<screen>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.bluefish.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bluefish co bluefish-gtk2</screen>
			Now, the sources are in the subdir <quote>bluefish-gtk2</quote> of your 
			current directory.</para>
			<para>If you want to take the actual version of the blufish sources, you can 
			simply make an update.
			You have to go in the subdir <quote>bluefish-gtk2</quote> and type 
			<userinput>cvs update</userinput>.
			If you have an modem or isdn internet access please have some patient.</para>
			<para>The next step is to create the <quote>configure</quote> script. 
			Execute <userinput>autoconf</userinput> to do that.</para>
			<para>If you have already compiled bluefish, run <userinput>make clean</userinput>
			to remove the compiled binaries and objects.</para>
			<para>Now, it's quite simple, like every open source software. 
			You have to run <userinput>make</userinput> to compile it.
			After that put the binaries and ressources to the place, where they were found: 
			type <userinput>make install</userinput>.</para>

		<title>installing a bluefish binary distribution</title>
		<para>For Debian users this is very simple. Just run the 
		command "apt-get install bluefish" and bluefish will be downloaded,
		installed and configured.</para>
		<para>For rpm based distributions, first check if your distribution does 
		have a recent Bluefish version. If it does not, download the rpm for your 
		distribution from any of the bluefish mirrors. to be finished......</para>
