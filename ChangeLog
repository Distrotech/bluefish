* 2.2.3 *

Bluefish 2.2.3 has mostly many minor bugfixes and many minor enhancements. There
are only few major changes: a corrupted state in the syntax scanner that could
lead to a segfault was fixed, code folding had major fixes and improvements,
search had major fixes, and a lorem ipsum generator was added. The GUI was
restructured in some areas, and some shortcut key combinations were added. Some
visibility features were added such as a bigger cursor and cursor highlighting,
and some options were improved such as zoom and the custom colors. External
commands had some changes such as better cursor positioning after a filter has
been used, user supplied arguments for external commands, and an option to
restore the default settings. On the multiplatform front: the broken shortcut
key S was fixed on OSX, and file recovery was fixed on Windows. On the web front
some dialogs were added for HTML5, the thumbnail generator was fixed, and insert
color, path and relative path have been added. Many language files were
improved, and more user configurable options have been added to most language
files. You can now select a block of text by dragging the mouse in the margin,
and move the selected block with <ctrl><up> and <ctrl><down>.   


* 2.2.2 *

Bluefish 2.2.2 is largely a bug fix release with some very minor new features. A
regression in the search functionality was fixed, that caused a segfault if a
document with search results was closed. Multiple replace with search results
directly next to each other corrupting the text was also fixed. The broken
cursor positioning that ruined the Zencoding plugin was also fixed. On the
multiplatform front: on Windows handling of the profile directory with non-ascii
characters was fixed and on MacOSX image browsing in the image dialog was fixed.
Two GTK-3 related bugs where fixed: the CSS dialog was unusable on GTK-3 and the
right margin indicator was positioned wrong. Next to the major fixes several
small memory leaks where fixed. Next to the bug fixes some small improvements
where made. Startup is slightly faster using more threads during startup and
improving the document recovery. The annoying scrolling of the side bar
filebrowser in 'treeview' mode was fixed, descriptions of language options where
fixed, and some menu strings, some HTML5 options where improved, accelerators
and shortcut keys got improved and translations got better. The new features: 
duplicate line and delete line, and the Catalan translation.

* 2.2.1 *

Bluefish 2.2.1 is mostly a bug fix release, but it has one major new feature:
Zencoding support (requires python). The bug fixes include a fix to build on
Gtk+-2.22, many translations are better up-to-date, a fix for PCRE regular
expression searching, several layout fixes for Gtk+-3.2, several obscure
segfault fixes, a fix for autocompletion of variables in PHP, <img> dialog
fixes, and some memory-leak fixes. 

* 2.2.0 *

Bluefish 2.2.0 is a new major release and the start for the 2.2 series. Under
the hood Bluefish 2.2.0 has a massive number of changes: Bluefish now works with
gtk-3 (gtk-2 is still supported), and the syntax scanner had a major overhaul to
make it faster, which is especially noticeable when working on large files.

Another big change in Bluefish 2.2.0 is the new search and replace function. It
has been completely redesigned: the simple search function is now integrated in
the main window, and the new function supports both search and replace in files
on disk (next to already opened documents). Other new features include a toggle
comment function that is context-aware (add <!-- --> comments in html code, use
// comments in javascript code, etc.) and a select block feature that
automatically selects the current context block and can be used multiple times
to select the parent blocks. Another new feature of the syntax recognition is
the autocompletion of user-defined functions, and a jump function that will
bring you immediately the the definition of a function.

Next to all the new features many existing features have been improved and
polished. Support for new languages has been added, such as Google Go, Vala and
Ada. See the introduction to Bluefish 2.2.0 movie for a good overview.
