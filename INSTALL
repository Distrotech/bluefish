To install Bluefish from source:

0) Installing from SVN requires some additional tools to create the build
   environment:

     automake, autoconf, libtool, gettext, intltool

   Then run:

     $ ./autogen.sh

1) Compilation needs the following software packages - usually the headers and
   libraries (search for packages with a -dev or -devel suffix and/or prefix
   lib, e.g. libgtk2.0-dev)

     - Glib 2.0 (>= 2.16)
     - Gtk 2.0 (>= 2.12)
     - libxml2
     - PCRE
     - zlib
     - Aspell (optional for spell checking)
     - Python (optional)
     
2) Configure the sources:

     $ ./configure [options-you-like-most-here]

   Calling the command with the --help option will show you all available
   options. They usually contain a help string to explain their function.

3) Compile the sources (report any errors, see README):

     $ make

4) Install everything. This usually needs root priviledges:

     # make install


For several Linux distributions compiled packages are available (e.g. Debian,
Ubuntu, RedHat) made by Bluefish developers and supporters. Our homepage tells
more about this.
