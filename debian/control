Description: A Gtk+ HTML editor
 Bluefish is a GTK HTML editor for the experienced web designer.  It is
 currently in alpha stage, but still usable.  Its features include nice
 wizards for startup, tables and frame; a fully featured image insert
 dialog; thumbnail creation and automatically linking of the thumbnail
 with the original image; and configurable HTML syntax highlighting.
 .
 For validation to work you need weblint.  For preview to work,
 you need a web browser that can view local files given to it
 on the command line.
