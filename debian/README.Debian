bluefish for Debian
-------------------

The version 1.0 of bluefish contains some changes to ~/.bluefish/rcfile_v2
and ~/.bluefish/highlighting. Now there are References-Files for HTML, CSS, PHP
and Python. If you are upgrading from an older version than 1.0, maybe you
want to backup your existing ~/.bluefish-directory and make a new one.
