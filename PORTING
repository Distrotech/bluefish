** CHANGES **

remove g_basename and strip_filename in favour of g_path_get_basename()
(free the string alloc'ed by g_path_get_basename() !!!!)

replace gtk_signal_connect with g_signal_connect
GTK_CALLBACK with G_CALLBACK

xpm images to png images and use gdk-pixbuf-csource to generate .c file 
for the images
remove the GtkPixmap widget in favour of GtkImage (use 
gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf)

** FEATURES **

The old reference dialogs are not to be ported, I would like to have 
a tree (just like the tree of files) on the left side where you can 
access all functions. We should also have python and perl support there.

The preferences dialog needs to be ported, but a lot of options are 
set by different means now (dynamically like the browsers, from the 
menu like the wrap, or simple from the current state like the window 
size). So in fact we need a new dialog.

The build system is not yet finished, and the location of files should 
be set

The internationalisation support is not ported yet, can go together 
with the build system.
